This is a tutorial by Code Commerce. His previous tutorial I did was for a todo list that used firebase to create a database. However it did not show how to make the database secure. 
I am following along with this tutorial to see how that is done to help with my understanding of the dox.

The tutorial is found here:

I had to take a break from working on this for the holidays and to focus on passing an assemnt. I am back but need to refresh on where I left off.
